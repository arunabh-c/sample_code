**Traps:** A trap is an interrupt generated by the CPU when a user-level program attempts 
to execute a privileged instruction or encounters an error. When a trap occurs, 
the CPU transfers control to the kernel and executes a trap handler. The trap 
handler checks the type of trap and takes appropriate action, such as terminating 
the program or performing a privileged operation on behalf of the program.

**System calls:** A system call is a request made by a user-level program to the OS to 
perform a privileged operation, such as reading from or writing to a file or allocating
memory. To make a system call, the program executes a special instruction that triggers 
a software interrupt. The OS then transfers control to the kernel and executes a system 
call handler. The system call handler checks the type of system call and takes appropriate 
action, such as reading from a file or allocating memory.

Traps and system calls are similar in that they both involve transferring control to the 
kernel to perform privileged operations. However, **traps are usually generated automatically
by the CPU when a program encounters an error** or attempts to execute a privileged instruction,
while **system calls are initiated by the program itself** to request privileged operations.
