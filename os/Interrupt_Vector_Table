As we have discussed in the last section, the vector table contains the address of the 
ISR routines of all interrupts and exceptions that the microcontroller supports.

If you check the datasheet of TM4C123G ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller, it has 15 
system exceptions and 138 peripheral interrupts. Peripheral interrupts are also
defined as simple exceptions in literature. The main difference between system 
exceptions and interrupts is that system exceptions are generated by the CPU 
and peripheral interrupts are generated by different peripheral modules 
available in ARM cortex based microcontrollers. 

In short, the IVT of TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller has 154 entries for all 
interrupts and exceptions.

But not all interrupts are available in TM4C123G microcontroller. Only 78 are 
available and space is reserved inside the vector table for those peripheral 
interrupts which are not available. These reserves interrupts might be 
available in other TI microcontrollers.

Where does IVT store in Microcontroller Memory? 
There are types of memory in microcontrollers such as code memory or 
data memory. The interrupt vector table stores in flash/code memory of ARM 
Cortex M4 microcontrollers.

If you explore the datasheet of TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller (page 107), 
the interrupt vector table stores at the starting addresses of code memory 
( starting from 0x0000_0000).

The first two entries of the vector table are the initial value of the 
stack pointer and the address of the reset handler function. Because 
whenever a microcontroller resets, it performs hardware initialization steps.
