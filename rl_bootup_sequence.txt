1. OVERVIEW:
Upon power-up or reset, GSP SUROM will perform self-tests, memory tests, initialization, and then will boot up the firmware image. 
The self-tests will test both the memory and logic circuitry. The memory tests will perform pattern tests on all RAM memories and then 
will perform read tests on EEPROM memory. After the initialization phase is completed, SUROM will select one of several image files 
stored in EEPROM memory for booting up.

2. LOW LEVEL TESTS:
2.1 SELF-TESTS:
Immediately upon POR reset, SUROM performs several signature self-tests for both the RAD750 and EMC circuitry. 
Two such tests are run on each processor. An array built-in self-test (ABIST) tests all memory circuitry while 
the logic built-in self-test (LBIST) test the logic circuitry.

2.2 RAM MEMORY TESTS:
SUROM performs RAM tests for both EMC and RAD750 RAM Memories. These tests perform sweeping pattern tests 
choosing patterns specifically for SECDED error correction coverage. Each RAM memory is then initialized to zero. 
The results of these tests are logged.

2.3 EEPROM MEMORY TESTS:
For the EEPROM memory tests, SUROM reads all of EEPROM memory in order to test for EDAC errors. 
The results of these tests are logged.

3. FIRMWARE IMAGE BOOT-UP:

3.1 FIRMWARE IMAGE SELECTION:
To save EEPROM storage space, the GSP firmware is stored in compressed form and must be inflated upon booting up.

To select a valid image, SUROM starts visiting each of the regions until a valid image is found. Once SUROM 
validates an image file it will use it for booting-up. A successful validation will stop SUROM’s search.

For validation, SUROM will test the image file’s header and perform a CRC test on the compressed data. 
If the comparison fails, SUROM assumes the image is corrupt and will move unto the next region’s image. 
The results of this search and selection process are stored in the boot up error log

3.2 FIRMWARE INFLATION:
Once a valid image is selected, SUROM will begin the inflation of the compressed image. The inflated image is stored GSP’s RAM memory. 
The compression and inflation algorithms use Mark Adler’s algorithm published in the public domain in 1993. 
This is equivalent to PKZIP’s method 8 format of compressed data.

Up to three attempts are made to inflate the compressed image. In order for an inflation to be considered successful, the inflated RAM image must pass a CRC test.

SUROM will store the results of the booting up process in the boot up error log

3.3 FIRMWARE EXECUTION:
After the firmware has been copied to RAM, SUROM will then transfer control to the first entry point of the firmware image. 
This transfer will be done even if the copied image is corrupt as no other viable processing can be performed. 

No further SUROM processing is done when flight firmware begins execution.
