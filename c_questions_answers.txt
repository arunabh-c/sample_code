/*What is the difference between #include "..." and #include <...>?

For "...", the preprocessor limits its search for the file to the same directory where the current source file resides, and then to the standard directories pre-designated by the compiler. For <...>, the preprocessor searches for the file in directories pre-designated by the compiler - usually directories where standard library header files reside.*/
