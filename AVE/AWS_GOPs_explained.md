Motivation to compress: uncompressed rates impossible with residential internet.

Resolution	              Uncompressed Bitrate
1280×720 (720p)	             ~ 1.5 Gbps
1920×1080 (1080p)	           ~ 3 Gbps
3180 x 2160 (2160p or 4K)	   ~ 12 Gbps

**2 Types of compression:**

Tempotral Compression: Successive frames only carry pixel difference from previous frame

Spatial Compression: Pixels in same frame can carry only delta info compared to neighboring pixels
